The files in here get copied out as 'default' files. See relevant code sections
in Platforming.java and DBXCRuntime.java (currently the three files are the 32-
and 64-bit versions of the Windows native library and the default upload script
which goes in the .../scripts directory).

The reason this exists is that I don't know of a better solution for having a
singular portable JAR/EXE that can reconstitute its home directory structure
by just being run all by itself without the aid of any installer. Other than
these three files, this program can recreate its directory structure wherever it
gets executed (it saves its files to ~/dbx/DBXCapture and treats that as the
working directory). I really don't want to turn this into an installer - just
have people download the .jar and run it, and everything works as it should;
they can move the JAR around and run it, add it to startup folder, whatever.
